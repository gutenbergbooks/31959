<h2>SEVEN POEMS AND A FRAGMENT: BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS.</h2>

<h3>ALL SOULS&rsquo; NIGHT</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&rsquo;Tis All Souls&rsquo; Night and the great Christ Church bell,</p>
<p>And many a lesser bell, sound through the room,</p>
<p>For it is now midnight;</p>
<p>And two long glasses brimmed with muscatel</p>
<p>Bubble upon the table. A ghost may come,</p>
<p>For it is a ghost&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>His element is so fine</p>
<p>Being sharpened by his death,</p>
<p>To drink from the wine-breath</p>
<p>While our gross palates drink from the whole wine.</p>

<p class="s">I need some mind that, if the cannon sound</p>
<p>From every quarter of the world, can stay</p>
<p>Wound in mind&rsquo;s pondering,</p>
<p>As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound;</p>
<p>Because I have a marvellous thing to say,</p>
<p>A certain marvellous thing</p>
<p>None but the living mock,</p>
<p>Though not for sober ear;</p>
<p>It may be all that hear</p>
<p>Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.</p>

<p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span></p>
<p>H&mdash;&rsquo;s the first I call. He loved strange thought</p>
<p>And knew that sweet extremity of pride</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called platonic love,</p>
<p>And that to such a pitch of passion wrought</p>
<p>Nothing could bring him, when his lady died,</p>
<p>Anodyne for his love.</p>
<p>Words were but wasted breath;</p>
<p>One dear hope had he:</p>
<p>The inclemency</p>
<p>Of that or the next winter would be death.</p>

<p class="s">Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell</p>
<p>Whether of her or God he thought the most,</p>
<p>But think that his mind&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>When upward turned, on one sole image fell,</p>
<p>And that a slight companionable ghost,</p>
<p>Wild with divinity,</p>
<p>Had so lit up the whole</p>
<p>Immense miraculous house,</p>
<p>The Bible promised us,</p>
<p>It seemed a gold-fish swimming in a bowl.</p>

<p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span></p>
<p>On Florence Emery I call the next,</p>
<p>Who finding the first wrinkles on a face</p>
<p>Admired and beautiful,</p>
<p>And knowing that the future would be vexed</p>
<p>With &rsquo;minished beauty, multiplied commonplace,</p>
<p>Preferred to teach a school,</p>
<p>Away from neighbour or friend</p>
<p>Among dark skins, and there</p>
<p>Permit foul years to wear</p>
<p>Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end.</p>

<p class="s">Before that end much had she ravelled out</p>
<p>From a discourse in figurative speech</p>
<p>By some learned Indian</p>
<p>On the soul&rsquo;s journey. How it is whirled about,</p>
<p>Wherever the orbit of the moon can reach,</p>
<p>Until it plunged into the sun;</p>
<p>And there free and yet fast,</p>
<p>Being both Chance and Choice,</p>
<p>Forget its broken toys</p>
<p>And sink into its own delight at last.</p>

<p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span></p>
<p>And I call up MacGregor from the grave,</p>
<p>For in my first hard springtime we were friends,</p>
<p>Although of late estranged.</p>
<p>I thought him half a lunatic, half knave,</p>
<p>And told him so, but friendship never ends;</p>
<p>And what if mind seem changed,</p>
<p>And it seem changed with the mind,</p>
<p>When thoughts rise up unbid</p>
<p>On generous things that he did</p>
<p>And I grow half contented to be blind.</p>

<p class="s">He had much industry at setting out,</p>
<p>Much boisterous courage, before loneliness</p>
<p>Had driven him crazed;</p>
<p>For meditations upon unknown thought</p>
<p>Make human intercourse grow less and less;</p>
<p>They are neither paid nor praised.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;d object to the host,</p>
<p>The glass because my glass;</p>
<p>A ghost-lover he was</p>
<p>And may have grown more arrogant being a ghost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span></p>
<p class="s">But names are nothing. What matter who it be,</p>
<p>So that his elements have grown so fine</p>
<p>The fume of muscatel</p>
<p>Can give his sharpened palate ecstasy</p>
<p>No living man can drink from the whole wine.</p>
<p>I have mummy truths to tell</p>
<p>Whereat the living mock,</p>
<p>Though not for sober ear,</p>
<p>For maybe all that hear</p>
<p>Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.</p>

<p class="s">Such thought&mdash;such thought have I that hold it tight</p>
<p>Till meditation master all its parts,</p>
<p>Nothing can stay my glance</p>
<p>Until that glance run in the world&rsquo;s despite</p>
<p>To where the damned have howled away their hearts,</p>
<p>And where the blessed dance;</p>
<p>Such thought, that in it bound</p>
<p>I need no other thing</p>
<p>Wound in mind&rsquo;s wandering,</p>
<p>As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF A BLACK
CENTAUR</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Your hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood,</p>
<p>Even where the horrible green parrots call and swing.</p>
<p>My works are all stamped down into the sultry mud.</p>
<p>I knew that horse play, knew it for a murderous thing.</p>
<p>What wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat</p>
<p>And that alone, yet I being driven half insane</p>
<p>Because of some green wing, gathered old mummy wheat</p>
<p>In the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain</p>
<p>And after baked it slowly in an oven; but now</p>
<p>I bring full flavoured wine out of a barrel found</p>
<p>Where seven Ephesian topers slept and never knew</p>
<p>When Alexander&rsquo;s empire past, they slept so sound.</p>
<p>Stretch out your limbs and sleep a long Saturnian sleep;</p>
<p>I have loved you better than my soul for all my words,</p>
<p>And there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep</p>
<p>Unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds.</p>

<h3>THOUGHTS UPON THE PRESENT
STATE OF THE WORLD.</h3>


<h5>I</h5>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Many ingenious lovely things are gone</p>
<p>That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude;</p>
<p>Above the murderous treachery of the moon</p>
<p>Or all that wayward ebb and flow. There stood</p>
<p>Amid the ornamental bronze and stone</p>
<p>An ancient image made of olive wood;</p>
<p>And gone are Phidias&rsquo; carven ivories</p>
<p>And all his golden grasshoppers and bees.</p>

<p class="s">We too had many pretty toys when young;</p>
<p>A law indifferent to blame or praise</p>
<p>To bribe or threat; habits that made old wrong</p>
<p>Melt down, as it were wax in the sun&rsquo;s rays;</p>
<p>Public opinion ripening for so long</p>
<p>We thought it would outlive all future days.</p>
<p>O what fine thought we had because we thought</p>
<p>That the worst rogues and rascals had died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span></p>
<p class="s">All teeth were drawn, all ancient tricks unlearned,</p>
<p>And a great army but a showy thing;</p>
<p>What matter that no cannon had been turned</p>
<p>Into a ploughshare; parliament and king</p>
<p>Thought that unless a little powder burned</p>
<p>The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting</p>
<p>And yet it lack all glory; and perchance</p>
<p>The guardsmen&rsquo;s drowsy chargers would not prance.</p>

<p class="s">Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare</p>
<p>Rides upon sleep: a drunken soldiery</p>
<p>Can leave the mother, murdered at her door,</p>
<p>To crawl in her own blood, and go scot-free;</p>
<p>The night can sweat with terror as before</p>
<p>We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,</p>
<p>And planned to bring the world under a rule</p>
<p>Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.</p>

<p class="s">He who can read the signs nor sink unmanned</p>
<p>Into the half-deceit of some intoxicant</p>
<p>From shallow wits, who knows no work can stand,</p>
<p>Whether health, wealth or peace of mind were spent</p>
<p>On master work of intellect or hand,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span></p>
<p>No honour leave its mighty monument,</p>
<p>Has but one comfort left: all triumph would</p>
<p>But break upon his ghostly solitude.</p>

<p class="s">And other comfort were a bitter wound:</p>
<p>To be in love and love what vanishes.</p>
<p>Greeks were but lovers; all that country round</p>
<p>None dared admit, if such a thought were his,</p>
<p>Incendiary or bigot could be found</p>
<p>To burn that stump on the Acropolis,</p>
<p>Or break in bits the famous ivories</p>
<p>Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees?</p>

<p>Of some most haughty deed or thought</p>
<p>That waits upon his future days,</p>

<p>I am jealous of the looks men turn on you</p>
<p>For all men love your worth; and I must rage</p>
<p>At my own image in the looking-glass</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so unlike myself that when you praise it</p>
<p>It is as though you praise another, or even</p>
<p>Mock me with praise of my mere opposite;</p>
<p>And when I wake towards morn I dread myself</p>
<p>For the heart cries that what deception wins</p>
<p>My cruelty must keep; and so begone</p>
<p>If you have seen that image and not my worth.</p>

<p class="r">CUCHULAIN.</p>

<p>All men have praised my strength but not my worth.</p>

<p class="r">THE GIRL.</p>

<p>If you are no more strength than I am beauty</p>
<p>I will find out some cavern in the hills</p>
<p>And live among the ancient holy men,</p>
<p>For they at least have all men&rsquo;s reverence</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span></p>
<p>And have no need of cruelty to keep</p>
<p>What no deception won.</p>

<p class="r">CUCHULAIN.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 7em;">I have heard them say</p>
<p>That men have reverence for their holiness</p>
<p>And not their worth.</p>

<p class="r">THE GIRL.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">God loves us for our worth;</p>
<p>But what care I that long for a man&rsquo;s love.</p>

<p class="r">THE FOOL BY THE ROADSIDE.</p>

<p>When my days that have</p>
<p>From cradle run to grave</p>
<p>From grave to cradle run instead;</p>
<p>When thoughts that a fool</p>
<p>Has wound upon a spool</p>
<p>Are but loose thread, are but loose thread;</p>

<p class="s">When cradle and spool are past</p>
<p>And I mere shade at last</p>
<p>Coagulate of stuff</p>
<p>Transparent like the wind,</p>
<p>I think that I may find</p>
<p>A faithful love, a faithful love.</p>

<p>Come nearer me, that I may know how face</p>
<p>Differs from face, and touch you with my hands.</p>
<p>O more than kin, O more than children could be,</p>
<p>For children are but born out of our blood</p>

<p>That I have nourished underneath my wings</p>
<p>And fed upon my soul. (He stands up and begins to walk</p>

<p>He needs no help that joy has lifted up</p>
<p>Like some miraculous beast out of Ezekiel.</p>
<p>The man that dies has the chief part in the story,</p>
<p>And I will mock and mock and mock that image yonder</p>
<p>That evil picture in the sky&mdash;no, no&mdash;</p>
<p>I have all my strength again, I will outface it.</p>
<p>O look upon the moon that&rsquo;s standing there</p>
<p>In the blue daylight&mdash;notice her complexion</p>
<p>Because it is the white of leprosy</p>
<p>And the contagion that afflicts mankind</p>
<p>Falls from the moon. When I and these are dead</p>
<p>We should be carried to some windy hill</p>
<p>To lie there with uncovered face awhile</p>
<p>That mankind and that leper there may know</p>

<p>King, king, he is dead; some strange triumphant thought</p>

<p>Being grown too mighty for our frailty,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span></p>
<p>And we who gaze grow like him and abhor</p>
<p>The moments that come between us and that death</p>
<p>You promised us.</p>

<p class="r">KING.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 7em;">Take up his body.</p>
<p>Go where you please and lay it where you please,</p>
<p>So that I cannot see his face or any</p>
<p>That cried him towards his death.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 14em;">Dead faces laugh!</p>

<p>And there he can sleep on, not noticing</p>

<p>You wrong his greatness speaking so of triumph.</p>

<p class="r">YOUNGEST PUPIL.</p>

<p>O silver trumpets, be you lifted up</p>
<p>And cry to the great race that is to come.</p>
<p>Long-throated swans upon the waves of time</p>
<p>Sing loudly, for beyond the wall of the world</p>
<p>That race may hear our music and awake.</p>

<p class="r">OLDEST PUPIL.</p>

<p>(motioning the musicians to lower their trumpets)</p>
<p>Not what it leaves behind it in the light</p>
<p>But what it carries with it to the dark</p>
<p>Exalts the soul; nor song nor trumpet-blast</p>
<p>Can call up races from the worsening world</p>
<p>To mend the wrong and mar the solitude</p>
<p>Of the great shade we follow to the tomb.</p>
<p>(Fedelm and the pupils go out carrying the litter. Some play</p>
<p>a mournful music.)</p>

<h3>NOTE ON &lsquo;THOUGHTS UPON THE PRESENT
STATE OF THE WORLD&rsquo; SECTION
SIX.</h3>


<p>The country people see at times certain apparitions
whom they name now &lsquo;fallen angels&rsquo; now &lsquo;ancient
inhabitants of the country,&rsquo; and describe as riding
at whiles &lsquo;with flowers upon the heads of the horses.&rsquo;
I have assumed in the sixth poem that these horsemen,
now that the times worsen, give way to worse.
My last symbol Robert Artisson was an evil spirit
much run after in Kilkenny at the start of the fourteenth
century. Are not those who travel in the
whirling dust also in the Platonic Year?&mdash;W. B. Y.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON THE NEW END TO &lsquo;THE
KING&rsquo;S THRESHOLD&rsquo;</h3>


<p>Upon the revival of this play at the Abbey Theatre
a few weeks ago it was played with this new end.
There were a few other changes. I had originally
intended to end the play tragically and would have
done so but for a friend who used to say &lsquo;O do write
comedy &amp; have a few happy moments in the Theatre.&rsquo;
My unhappy moments were because a tragic
effect is very fragile and a wrong intonation, or even
a wrong light or costume will spoil it all. However
the play remained always of the nature of tragedy
and so subject to vicissitude.</p>
